TWLOHW is an AppleScript application that scans all your Facebook friends’ status updates for any worrying key words. It tabulates them into a CSV file saved on your desktop, so you can come alongside your friend, and show them that you care.

Known issues:

The word association checking (string contains string) isn’t very good.
It has to open Safari to get an Access Token from Facebook.
The source code is free to use under the Apache 2 license, which means you can basically do whatever you like with it. The icon is taken from Azuzephre’s Pon and Zi comic:http://www.azuzephre.net/azuzephre.net/The_Pon%26Zi_Collection.html#30.

Thank Jesus that we’re not alone, and he went through even worse.
